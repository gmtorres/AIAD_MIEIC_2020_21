The real estate market is in trend at the moment. For this project we aim to implement a SMA which interactions between agents simulate the transactions between real estate agents, real estate agencies and buyers/sellers of a property. This wy we have several agents involved in each interaction, with different goals each: 
- real estate agency: Employa set of real estate agents capable of maximize its profits
- real estate agent: Maximize each selling property, presenting results to its agency
- buyer: Find the best suitable property for his needs at the best price
- seller: Sell the property at the hightest price possible

The real estate agencies have rates to which the agents are forced to pay. The interactions between agents, like buying/selling, are dinamic and each agent looks for its interests, having space for cooperation.

As independent variable we have the number os each agent type, as their personalities, the restriciton in terms of mowy they need to sell the property or have available to buy one, and the type of property at sale, all of this can influence the system's dinamic.

As dependent variables, we can analyse the fluz of sales by real estate agencies and agent, the profit of each agent and, also, the global economic state of the sistem, if there is an economic break or a spike.
